# Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations

## Overview

**Shopper Spectrum** is an E-commerce and Retail Analytics project that leverages transaction data to uncover customer insights and drive business growth. By analyzing customer purchase behaviors and transaction patterns, this project enables:

- Customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering.
- Data-driven marketing strategies through target audience identification.
- Personalized product recommendations using collaborative filtering.
- Data visualization for exploratory analysis.

## Problem Statement

Online retail businesses generate large volumes of transaction data. Extracting actionable insights from this data is key for:

- Understanding customer lifecycle and value.
- Designing targeted marketing campaigns.
- Improving customer retention and loyalty.
- Recommending relevant products.

---

## Business Use Cases

- **Targeted Marketing:** Segment customers for personalized campaigns.
- **Churn Prediction:** Identify at-risk customers and take retention actions.
- **Product Recommendation:** Personalized suggestions to boost sales and engagement.
- **Inventory Optimization:** Forecast demand and manage stock efficiently.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices based on customer behavior.

## Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection & Understanding**
   - Load and preview retail transaction data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning: Remove invalid records and handle missing values.
   - Feature Engineering: Create necessary columns (e.g., TotalPrice).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize sales trends, top products, and customer geography.
4. **RFM Feature Engineering**
   - Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores per customer.
5. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to segment customers.
6. **Product Recommendation System**
   - Build collaborative filtering models to suggest products.
7. **Interactive Dashboard (optional)**
   - Deploy insights and recommendations using Streamlit.
